The mockextras library is designed to be used with the unittest.mock library in python 3 or the mock
backport of this (http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/) in python 2. The mockextras library adds
a number of features that are found in other mocking libraries namely:

* a fluent API for the configuration of stubs
* stubs
* matchers
